2. **OpenTelemetry instrumentation** - Requires adding OTel SDK to actual services

### Testing (Requires Running Services)
3. **E2E test automation** - Requires actual UI and API endpoints

### Optional Enhancements
4. **Alert routing setup** - Slack/PagerDuty webhook configuration (documentation provided)
5. **Unit test coverage** - Service-specific tests (requires actual service code)

âœ… **Reliable messaging**: Outbox pattern with retry/backoff  
âœ… **Site-scoped security**: RLS/ABAC by default  
âœ… **Observability first**: Prometheus/Grafana/Loki/Tempo stack  
âœ… **Feature flag governance**: Shadow â†’ Staged â†’ Enable workflow
