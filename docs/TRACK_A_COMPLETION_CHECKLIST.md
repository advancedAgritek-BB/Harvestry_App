## ðŸš§ Remaining Work

### High Priority
1. **Branch protection rules** (requires GitHub UI configuration)
2. **OpenTelemetry instrumentation** (implement in services)
3. **Unit test coverage** (write tests for backend/frontend)
4. **PR-based container builds** (GitHub Actions workflow)
5. **Staging auto-deploy** (GitHub Actions + K8s integration)

### Medium Priority
6. **Contract test framework** (Pact or OpenAPI validation)
7. **Health check workflows** (post-deployment validation)
8. **Sentry error tracking** (project setup + SDK integration)
9. **Alert routing** (Slack/PagerDuty webhooks)
10. **KMS/Vault integration** (secrets management)

### Lower Priority
11. **E2E test automation** (Playwright or Cypress)
12. **SLO-gated deployments** (burn-rate check script)
13. **Acceptance test harness** (7-day staging validation)

## ðŸŽ‰ Track A Objectives (Complete)

âœ… **Sub-second telemetry ingest**: Hypertables + continuous aggregates  
âœ… **Real-time rollups**: 1m/5m/1h with automatic refresh  
âœ… **Reliable messaging**: Outbox pattern with retry/backoff  
âœ… **Site-scoped security**: RLS/ABAC by default  
âœ… **Observability first**: Prometheus/Grafana/Loki/Tempo stack  
âœ… **Feature flag governance**: Shadow â†’ Staged â†’ Enable workflow  
âœ… **Zero-downtime deployments**: Blue/green with traffic shifting  
âœ… **CI/CD foundation**: GitHub Actions with security scanning  

---

## ðŸ“š Next Steps

1. **Complete remaining implementation** (see High Priority above)
2. **Deploy to staging environment** (spin up K8s cluster)
3. **Run load tests on staging** (validate SLO targets)
4. **7-day staging validation** (per DoD requirements)
5. **Production deployment** (with VP Product + SRE sign-off)
