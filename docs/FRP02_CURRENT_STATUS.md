## 🔄 EXECUTION PLAN REFINED (2025-09-30)

**Major improvements made to implementation plan:**

### ✅ Added Pre-Slice Foundation Work (90 min)

**Problem:** Original plan jumped directly to service implementation without addressing:
- How repositories materialize domain entities (reflection is slow/fragile)
- How controllers return data (exposing domain entities directly)
- How to wire up all components (configuration as afterthought)

**Solution:** Added explicit pre-slice setup phase:

1. **FromPersistence Factories (45 min)**
   - Add static factory methods to all 5 domain entities
   - Enables type-safe rehydration without reflection
   - Pattern: `Room.FromPersistence(id, siteId, code, ...)`

2. **DTO Mapping Profile (20 min)**
   - Create dedicated response DTOs: `RoomResponse`, `LocationResponse`, `EquipmentResponse`
   - Separate API contracts from domain model (enables versioning)
   - Manual mapping (no AutoMapper dependency): `RoomMapper.ToResponse(room)`

3. **Configuration Checklist (25 min)**
   - Update `Program.cs` with all DI registrations
   - Add `SPATIAL_DB_CONNECTION` to appsettings/secrets
   - Document environment variables for operations
   - Ensure all components wired before slice implementation

### ✅ Strengthened Multi-Tenant Design

**Before:**
```
GET /api/rooms/{id}
PUT /api/rooms/{id}
```

**After:**
```
GET /api/sites/{siteId}/rooms/{roomId}
PUT /api/sites/{siteId}/rooms/{roomId}
```

**Why:** Site-scoped routes make tenant isolation explicit, improve security audit trail

### ✅ Updated Time Estimates (More Realistic)

| Aspect | Original | Revised | Reason |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|
| Total Time | 23-30h | 28.5h | Accounts for all work (not just features) |
| Timeline | 4 days | 5 days | Includes foundation work + testing |
| Slice 1 | 5-6h | 7-8h | Includes routing + DTOs + mappers |

**Still on track:** 28.5h is realistic vs FRP-01's 32h (similar scope)

### ✅ Implementation Details Now Explicit

**Service Interface Example:**
```csharp
// Before (implicit): GetRoomByIdAsync(Guid roomId, ...)
// After (explicit):   GetRoomByIdAsync(Guid siteId, Guid roomId, ...)
```

**Repository Mapping Example:**
```csharp
// Before: "Use reflection or manual mapping"
// After:  return Room.FromPersistence(id, siteId, code, ...)
```

**Controller Response Example:**
```csharp
// Before: return Ok(room);
// After:  return Ok(RoomMapper.ToResponse(room));
```

### 📊 Impact Assessment

**Architecture:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- More production-ready (no reflection, proper DTOs)
- Better maintainability (explicit patterns)
- Industry best practices (Martin Fowler, Microsoft guidance)

**Realism:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- 28.5h accounts for setup, testing, validation, deployment
- Based on FRP-01 actuals (32h)
- No surprises or hidden work

**Risk:** 🟢 LOW
- Foundation work isolated and testable
- Clear dependencies between phases
- No blockers identified

**Recommendation:** ✅ **PROCEED WITH REVISED PLAN**
