- **3 enum files** with 13 enumerations
- Proper DDD patterns (Entity<Guid>, AggregateRoot<Guid>)
- Business logic encapsulated
- All user fixes applied (proper inheritance, FK alignment)

---

## 🚧 What's Remaining (Phase 3-7)

### Critical Path Items:

**Phase 3: Application Services** (4 services, ~4-5 hours remaining)
- ✅ SpatialHierarchyService complete (site-aware)
- 🚧 EquipmentRegistryService pending
- 🚧 CalibrationService pending
- 🚧 ValveZoneMappingService pending

**Phase 4: Infrastructure** (3 repositories remaining, ~3 hours)
- ✅ Room + Location repositories with RLS + `FromPersistence`
- 🚧 Equipment & calibration repositories pending

**Phase 5: API Controllers** (2 controllers remaining, ~3 hours)
- ✅ Rooms/Locations controllers implemented (403 diagnostics)
- 🚧 Equipment/Calibration controllers pending
- 🚧 Swagger docs + middleware polish pending

**Phase 6-7: Validation & Testing** (~6-7 hours remaining)
- ✅ FluentValidation for rooms/locations
- 🚧 Validators for equipment/calibration
- ✅ Spatial hierarchy unit & integration tests
- 🚧 Remaining unit/integration/E2E suites

---

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Continue Building (Recommended ✅)
**Action:** Tackle Slice 2 (Equipment Registry)
- Implement equipment service/repository/controller next (~6 hours)
- Follow with calibration + valve mapping slices
- Locks in dependencies for FRP-06 irrigation

### Option 2: Review & Adjust
**Action:** Mid-FRP checkpoint after 65% completion
- Validate equipment telemetry requirements and calibration flows before coding
- Confirm ops acceptance of shared vs dedicated spatial DB choice

### Option 3: Pause for Other Work
**Action:** Context switch to different priorities
- FRP-02 can resume later
- Clear documentation makes handoff easy

## 💪 Strengths

1. ✅ **Solid Foundation** - Schema, domain, and core spatial slice (service+repos+controllers) are production-ready
2. ✅ **Clean Architecture** - Following proven FRP-01 patterns
3. ✅ **Comprehensive** - Supports both cultivation and warehouse use cases
4. ✅ **Flexible** - User-defined room types, extensible equipment registry
5. ✅ **Production-Ready Features** - Fault codes, built-in templates, computed columns

---

## ⚡ Key Innovations

1. **Universal Location Hierarchy** - Single table supports cultivation AND warehouse paths
2. **Equipment Type Registry** - Custom types mapped to core enums for governance
3. **Device Twin Pattern** - JSON storage for discovered capabilities
4. **Many-to-Many Valve Routing** - Supports complex irrigation matrices
5. **Materialized Path** - Auto-calculated hierarchy paths for fast queries
6. **Built-in Templates** - HSES12, HSEA24, HydroCore, RoomHub, EdgePods pre-configured

## 📈 Comparison to FRP-01

| Metric | FRP-01 | FRP-02 (Current) | Status |
|--------|--------|------------------|--------|
| **Estimated Hours** | 52-65h | 23-30h | ✅ Smaller scope |
| **Actual Hours** | 32h | 9.5h | 🚧 In progress |
| **% Ahead of Estimate** | 38% faster | ~7% slower (projected) | 🟡 Within range |
| **Lines of Code** | ~10,500 | ~3,700 (65% done) | 🚧 In progress |
| **Complexity** | High (auth, ABAC) | Medium (CRUD + hierarchy) | ✅ Less complex |

**Projection:** Based on FRP-01 velocity, FRP-02 likely to complete in ~28.5 hours total (slightly behind the 26.5h midpoint of original 23-30h estimate, but within range)

## 🎓 Lessons Applied from FRP-01

1. ✅ **Clean Architecture** - Domain → Application → Infrastructure → API
2. ✅ **Security-First** - RLS from day 1
3. ✅ **DDD Patterns** - Proper entity inheritance, aggregate roots
4. ✅ **Testing Strategy** - Unit + Integration + E2E
5. ✅ **Validation** - FluentValidation with centralized constants
6. ✅ **Connection Pooling** - NpgsqlDataSource pattern
7. ✅ **Audit Trail** - Created/Updated by/at fields
8. ✅ **Canonical JSON** - Available for any audit needs

## 🔍 Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Schema changes needed** | Low | Medium | Comprehensive upfront design |
| **RLS performance** | Low | Medium | Indexed properly, tested in FRP-01 |
| **Hierarchy query complexity** | Low | Low | Materialized path pattern proven |
| **Equipment device twin size** | Low | Low | JSONB indexing, compression available |
| **Integration test complexity** | Medium | Low | Reuse FRP-01 test infrastructure |

**Overall Risk:** 🟢 **LOW** - Well-designed, proven patterns
