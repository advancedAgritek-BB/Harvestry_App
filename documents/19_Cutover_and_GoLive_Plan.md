# Cutover & Go-Live Plan (Pilot)

- Data seeding; device enrollment; feature flags set (closed-loop OFF; two-way Slack OFF).
- Dry run with design partners; on-call rotation active; rollback plan rehearsed.
- Change freeze window during cutover; status comms cadence established.
- Post-go-live hypercare: daily standups, issue triage, telemetry review.
