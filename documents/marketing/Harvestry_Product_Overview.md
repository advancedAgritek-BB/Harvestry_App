# Harvestry

## The Modern Cultivation Operating System

**Unify your grow. Simplify compliance. Optimize everything.**

---

## From Seed to Sale, Seamlessly Connected

Cannabis cultivation has evolved. It's no longer just about growing—it's about precision, compliance, traceability, and operational excellence at scale. Yet most operators are still cobbling together disconnected tools: spreadsheets for scheduling, separate apps for climate monitoring, manual processes for compliance, and siloed financial data that never quite reconciles.

**Harvestry changes everything.**

We built the first true Cultivation Operating System—a single, unified platform that connects every aspect of your operation: from the sensors monitoring your substrate to the compliance reports landing on regulators' desks, from the tasks your team completes daily to the journal entries in your accounting system.

This isn't another point solution. This is the command center your cultivation deserves.

- Full cost tracking: nutrients, labor, waste, yield
- Reconciliation reports you can actually trust

### Operators & Technicians

Your day just got simpler. Receive tasks on your phone or in Slack, log observations with a quick photo, and let the system handle the paperwork. Badge in, get your assignments, and know exactly what needs attention.

**Your wins:**
- Tasks assigned based on training certification
- Slack integration for real-time task notifications
- Evidence capture right from your device
