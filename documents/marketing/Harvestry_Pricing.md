# Harvestry OS – Pricing & Packaging

_Last updated: 2025-12-06_

Harvestry is the unified **Cultivation Operating System**. Our pricing is designed to grow with you—from your first room to your multi-state expansion.

---

## 1. The Strategy: "Land and Expand"
**Free to Start.**
We match the "low barrier" competitors with a genuinely free tier for single-room monitoring using our hardware controllers.

**Scales with Success.**
No "Compliance Tax." No "Integration Fees." As you grow from a single room to a licensed facility, our software evolves from a dashboard into a full Operating System.

**Hardware Independence.**
Use Harvestry Controllers with *any* sensor (4-20mA, 0-10V, SDI-12). Don't get locked into proprietary, expensive sensors. Bring what you have or buy off-the-shelf; we bring the intelligence.
